# Chrisma-Password-Generator

## About the Project

The Password generator project was completed using the starter code provided by the Skills for life and Edx FrontEnd Web Development Bootcamp. The pseudocode was provided by our instructor Laura Cole. JavaScript code was written to make the password generator work.

Creating this repo was helpful to understand the various objects, methods, and functions that were taught in the recent modules of the bootcamp. The functions, loops, arrays, data types were used, manipualted to achieve a working random password generator.

The intial challenge was to link the button to the password creation including the gathering of the data from the user through the prompt window. Our teaching assistant Ms Priyanka Christine, helped me understand the format laid in the starter code and this allowed me to get started on writing the code under the correct function.

Validating the user input has been tricky and the for loops, conditional statements have been used to achieve a basic level of user experience and input validation. I am aware that it needs refinement and possible tweaking of the input validation to achieve industry standards. I intend to work on this further to achieve this. 

The password generator lets the user choose the length of the password and the characters they prefer. On clicking the generate Password button, the prompts take the user input and manipulate the 4 arrays present to create an unique password, while making sure that the user's choices are taken into account.

For example, if the user chooses 15 characters for the length of password and then chooses the numeric characters and special characters- the javascript code written will create an unique password that is 15 characters long and containing a minimum of one numeric character and 1 special character in the mix of the password generated. This ensures that the criterias are met. The user will need to input their choices through the prompt window accurately.

The git commands have been used for version control throughout the creation of this repository.
